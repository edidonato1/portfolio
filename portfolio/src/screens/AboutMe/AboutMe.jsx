              <p>An ambitious lifetime learner, I've always been curious about the architecture of the internet â€” 
              In early 2020, that curiosity pivoted into an obsession. 
              Since then I've poured every ounce of myself into learning the languages that connect
              nearly every human on the planet.  
            </p>
              <p>In a past life, I was an award winning cocktail bartender, competing in all corners of the country,
               and around the world.  And while I've left a lot behind to pursue web development, a lot has followed me 
                in my career as a developer.
              </p>
              I'm obsessed with creating products with purpose, driven to invoke delight.  I believe 
              that there's no problem that isn't worth solving, and it's my goal to make products that will inspire, excite, 
              and genuinely improve people's lives.
              <p>If you share my passion, I'd love to hear from you.</p>
