##  the application
I began the construction of this application several weeks before the completion of a software engineering immersive program through General Assembly.  It represents a home for all of my work, as well as a way to showcase my interest in web design, without boundaries.

As are many projects, this application is an ever-evolving passion project as much as it is a professional device.
